# SUI Koober

The purpose of this project is to experiment with the new frameworks released in WWDC 2019. As such, the main focus of this project is for **learning**. 

Here are the basic guidelines for contribution:

* Write small, bite-sized PRs with accompanying details to explain the changes. You should write the description as if you are trying to teach a concept. This is really helpful for reviewers to understand how your changes affect the app - especially since we're all tackling a brand new way to iOS development.
* Make sure you adhere to the ![style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide). This really helps with review and keeps the flow of the codebase as consistent as possible. 

Since this app is based on ![Advanced iOS Architecture](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/advanced-ios-app-architecture), it would be useful to read through the book to get an understanding on the direction of the project
